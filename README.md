## ruby

### Application deployed to Heroku

In description you can find the url: https://thawing-ridge-85057.herokuapp.com/ that is root of api

But to reach the data I created namespace /api/v1/ ; So it is possible to GET the data in JSON form on https://thawing-ridge-85057.herokuapp.com/api/v1/companies with the cURL

### For how to use cURL please check [cURLreadme.md](https://github.com/martinheinr/ruby/blob/master/cURLreadme.md)
