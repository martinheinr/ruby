## ruby

### Application deployed to Heroku

In description you can find the url: https://thawing-ridge-85057.herokuapp.com/ is root of app

But to reach the data I created namespace /api/v1/ ; So it is possible to GET the data in JSON form on https://thawing-ridge-85057.herokuapp.com/api/v1/companies with the cURL

### For how to use cURL please check [a relative link](ruby/cURLreadme.md )
